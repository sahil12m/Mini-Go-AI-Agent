# Mini-Go-AI-Agent

The project involves creating AI agents using various techniques learned in class, specifically focusing on Search, Game Playing, and Reinforcement Learning. The goal is to develop agents capable of playing a simplified version of the Go game known as Go-5x5 or Little-Go. This variant has a reduced board size of 5x5, presenting a more manageable challenge. Your AI agent will engage in games against both basic and advanced AI opponents, demonstrating its proficiency in strategic decision-making and gameplay. The project aims to showcase your understanding and application of AI concepts, emphasizing practical skills in developing intelligent agents for strategic games.

 ## Game Description
 Go is an abstract strategy board game for two players, in which the aim is to surround more territory than the opponent. The basic concepts of Go (Little-Go) are very simple:
Players: Go is played by two players, called Black and White.
Board: The Go board is a grid of horizontal and vertical lines. The standard size of the board is  19x19, but in this homework, the board size will be 5x5.
 Point: The lines of the board have intersections wherever they cross or touch each other. Each intersection is called a point. Intersections at the four corners and the edges of the board are also called points. Go is played on the points of the board, not on the squares.
 Stones: Black uses black stones. White uses white stones. The basic process of playing the Go (Little-Go) game is also very simple: It starts with an empty board, Two players take turns placing stones on the board, one stone at a time, The players may choose any unoccupied point to play on (except for those forbidden by the “KO” and “no-suicide” rules. Once played, a stone can never be moved and can be taken off the board only if it is captured. The entire game of Go (Little-Go) is played based on two simple rules: Liberty (No-Suicide) and KO.
